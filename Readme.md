For data migration from excel to database i have followed following steps-


1.My code firstly read the data from excel sheet and you can see that data as output in my console when  you run my project.



2.after that i am taking excel data row by row and storing in variable of similar type as in excel.


3.the variable i am using to enter data in database.


4.i am sending data row , mean first copy one row then pasting that data in database.


5.after complete transfer of data we got a message that data exported successfully.
